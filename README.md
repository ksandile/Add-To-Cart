This app is build using HTML, CSS, Firebase, Netlify and JavaScript. Frontend I used HTML to defines the structure and content of my web application, and CSS to style and presentating. Backend I used Firebase to help me simplifly and accelerates my process by offering me a comprehensive set of tools and services that helped me on various aspects of my app development and it made it easier for me to build a high quality and scalable app. I used Netlify to streamline my development process. And JavaScript that helped me to create dynamic, interactive, and responsive web applications by manipulating the DOM, handling events, and facilitating communication with servers, among other capabilities.
